	<p class="blurb"><em>Mayhem, the man of many
	bodies, had been given some
	weird assignments in his time,

	was downright impossible!</em></p>
</div>

<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> SOS crackled and
hummed through subspace
at a speed which left
laggard light far behind. Since
subspace distances do not coincide
with normal space distances,
the SOS was first
picked up by a Fomalhautian
freighter bound for Capella
although it had been issued
from a point in normal space
midway between the orbit of
Mercury and the sun’s <ins title="original reads 'cornea'">corona</ins>
in the solar system.</p>

</div>

<p>The radioman of the Fomalhautian
freighter gave the
distress signal to the Deck
Officer, who looked at it,
blinked, and bolted ’bove decks
to the captain’s cabin. His face
<!-- Original location of full-page illustration -->
<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>was very white when he
reached the door and his heart
pounded with excitement. As
the Deck Officer crossed an
electronic beam before the
door a metallic voice said:
“The Captain is asleep and
will be disturbed for nothing
but emergency priority.”</p>

<p>Nodding, the Deck officer
stuck his thumb in the whorl-lock
of the door and entered
the cabin. “Begging your pardon,
sir,” he cried, “but we
just received an SOS from—”</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The Captain stirred groggily,
sat up, switched on a
green night light and squinted
through it at the Deck Officer.
“Well, what is it? Isn’t the
Eye working?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. An SOS, sir….”</p>

<p>“If we’re close enough to
help, subspace or normal
space, take the usual steps,
lieutenant. Surely you don’t
need me to—”</p>

<p>“The usual steps can’t be
taken, sir. Far as I can make
out, that ship is doomed. She’s
bound on collision course for
Sol, only twenty million miles
out now.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad, lieutenant,”
the Captain said with
genuine sympathy in his voice.
“I’m sorry to hear that. But
what do you want me to do
about it?”</p>

<p>“The ship, sir. The ship that
sent the SOS—hold on to your
hat, sir—”</p>

<p>“Get to the point now, will
you, young man?” the Captain
growled sleepily.</p>

<p>“The ship which sent the
SOS signal, the ship heading
on collision course for Sol, is
the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>!”</p>

<p>For a moment the Captain
said nothing. Distantly, you
could hear the hum of the subspace
drive-unit and the faint
whining of the stasis generator.
Then the Captain bolted
out of bed after unstrapping
himself. In his haste he forgot
the ship was in weightless
deep space and went sailing,
arms flailing air, across the
room. The lieutenant helped
him down and into his magnetic-soled
shoes.</p>

<p>“My God,” the Captain said
finally. “Why did it happen?
Why did it have to happen to
the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>?”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do,
sir?”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> can’t do anything. I won’t
take the responsibility. Have
the radioman contact the Hub
at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><i>The Glory of the Galaxy</i>,
the SOS ship heading on collision
course with the sun, was
making its maiden run from
the assembly satellites of
Earth across the inner solar
system via the perihelion passage
<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"> </a>which would bring it
within twenty-odd million
miles of the sun, to Mars
which now was on the opposite
side of Sol from Earth.
Aboard the gleaming new ship
was the President of the Galactic
Federation and his entire
cabinet.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The Fomalhautian freighter’s
emergency message was
received at the Hub of the
Galaxy within moments after
it had been sent, although the
normal space distance was in
the neighborhood of one hundred
thousand light years.
The message was bounced—in
amazingly quick time—from
office to office at the hub,
cutting through the usual red
tape because of its top priority.
And—since none of the
normal agencies at the Hub
could handle it—the message
finally arrived at an office
which very rarely received official
messages of any kind.
This was the one unofficial,
extra-legal office at the Hub of
the Galaxy. Lacking official
function, the office had no
technical existence and was
not to be found in any Directory
of the Hub. At the moment,
two young men were
seated inside. Their sole job
was to maintain <ins title="original reads 'liason'">liaison</ins> with
a man whose very existence
was doubted by most of the
human inhabitants of the Galaxy
but whose importance
could not be measured by mere
human standards in those early
days when the Galactic
League was becoming the Galactic
Federation.</p>

<p>The name of the man with
whom they maintained contact
was Johnny Mayhem.</p>

<p>“Did you read it?” the blond
man asked.</p>

<p>“I read it.”</p>

<p>“If it got down here, that
means they can’t handle it
anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“Of course they can’t. What
the hell could normal slobs like
them or like us do about it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I guess. But wait
a minute! You don’t mean
you’re going to send Mayhem,
without asking him, without
telling—”</p>

<p>“We can’t ask him now, can
we?”</p>

<p>“Johnny Mayhem’s <em>elan</em> is
at the moment speeding from
Canopus to Deneb, where on
the fourth planet of the Denebian
system a dead body is
waiting for him in cold
storage. The turnover from
League to Federation status
of the Denebian system is
causing trouble in Deneb City,
so Mayhem—”</p>

<p>“Deneb City will probably
survive without Mayhem.
Well, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, but—”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"> </a>“I know. The deal is we’re
supposed to tell Mayhem
where he’s going and what he
can expect. The deal also is,
every inhabited world has a
body waiting for his <em>elan</em> in
cold storage. But don’t you
think if we could talk to Mayhem
now—”</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible. He’s in
transit.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think if we could
talk to him now he would
agree to board the <em>Glory of
the Galaxy</em>?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? I’m
not Johnny Mayhem.”</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t board her, it’s
certain death for all of them.”</p>

<p>“And if he does board her,
what the hell can he do about
it? Besides, there isn’t any
dead body awaiting his <em>elan</em>
on that ship or any ship. He
wouldn’t make a very efficacious
ghost.”</p>

<p>“But there are live people.
Scores of them. Mayhem’s <em>elan</em>
is quite capable of possessing
a living host.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Theoretically it is.
But damn it all, what would
the results be? We’ve never
tried it. It’s liable to damage
Mayhem. As for the host—”</p>

<p>“The host might die. I know
it. But he’ll die anyway. The
whole shipload of them is
heading on collision course for
the sun.”</p>

<p>“Does the SOS say why?”</p>

<p>“No. Maybe Mayhem can
find out and do something
about it.”</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Yeah, maybe. That’s a hell
of a way to risk the life of
the most important man in the
Galaxy. Because if Mayhem
boards that ship and can’t do
anything about it, he’ll die
with the rest of them.”</p>

<p>“Why? We could always
pluck his <em>elan</em> out again.”</p>

<p>“<em>If</em> he were inhabiting a
dead one. In a live body, I
don’t think so. The attraction
would be stronger. There
would be forces of cohesion—”</p>

<p>“That’s true. Still, Mayhem’s
our only hope.”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit it’s a job for
Mayhem, but he’s too important.”</p>

<p>“Is he? Don’t be a fool.
What, actually, is Johnny
Mayhem’s importance? His
importance lies in the very
fact that he is expendable. His
life—for the furtherance of
the new Galactic Federation.”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“And the President is
aboard that ship. Maybe he
can’t do as much for the Galaxy
in the long run as Mayhem
can, but don’t you see,
man, he’s a figurehead. Right
now he’s the most important
man in the Galaxy, and if we
could talk to him I’m sure
<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"> </a>Mayhem would agree. Mayhem
would want to board that
ship.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny, we’ve been
working with Mayhem all
these years and we never even
met the guy.”</p>

<p>“Would you know him if
you saw him?”</p>

<p>“Umm-mm, I guess not. Do
you think we really can halt
his <em>elan</em> in subspace and divert
it over to the <em>Glory of the
Galaxy</em>?”</p>

<p>“I take it you’re beginning
to see things my way. And the
answer to your question is
yes.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mayhem. You know,
I actually feel sorry for the
guy. He’s had more adventures
than anyone since
Homer wrote the <i>Odyssey</i> and
there won’t ever be any rest
for him.”</p>

<p>“Stop feeling sorry for him
and start hoping he succeeds.”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“And let’s see about getting
a <ins title="original was italicized">bead</ins> on his <ins title="original was not italicized"><em>elan</em></ins>.”</p>

<p>The two young men walked
to a tri-dim chart which took
up much of the room. One of
them touched a button and
blue light glowed within the
chart, pulsing brightly and
sharply where space-sectors
intersected.</p>

<p>“He’s in C-17 now,” one of
the men said as a gleaming
whiteness was suddenly superimposed
at a single point
on the blue.</p>

<p>“Can you bead him?”</p>

<p>“I think so. But I still feel
sorry for Mayhem. He’s expecting
to wake up in a cold-storage
corpse on Deneb IV
but instead he’ll come to in a
living body aboard a spaceship
on collision course for the
sun.”</p>

<p>“Just hope he—”</p>

<p>“I know. Succeeds. I don’t
even want to think of the possibility
he might fail.”</p>

<p>In seconds, the gleaming
white dot crawled across the
surface of the tri-dim chart
from sector C-17 to sector S-1.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>
was now nineteen million
miles out from the sun and
rushing through space at a
hundred miles per second, normal
space drive. The <em>Glory of
the Galaxy</em> thus moved a million
miles closer to fiery destruction
every three hours—but
since the sun’s gravitational
force had to be added
to that speed, the ship was
slated to plunge into the sun’s
<ins title="original reads 'cornea'">corona</ins> in little more than
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Since the ship’s refrigeration
units would function perfectly
until the outer hull
reached a temperature of
eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit,
none of its passengers
<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>knew that anything was
wrong. Even the members of
the crew went through all the
normal motions. Only the
<i>Glory of the Galaxy’s</i> officers
in their bright new uniforms
and gold braid knew the grim
truth of what awaited the
gleaming two-thousand ton
spaceship less than twenty-four
hours away at the exact
center of its perihelion
passage.</p>

<p>Something—unidentified as
yet—in all the thousands of
intricate things that could go
wrong on a spaceship, particularly
a new one making its
maiden voyage, had gone
wrong. The officers were
checking their catalogues and
their various areas of watch
meticulously—and not because
their own lives were at stake.
In spaceflight, your own life
always is at stake. There are
too many imponderables: you
are, to a certain degree, expendable.
The commissioned
contingent aboard the <em>Glory
of the Galaxy</em> was a dedicated
group, hand-picked from all
the officers in the solar system.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">But they could find nothing.
And do nothing.</p>

<p>Within a day, their lives
along with the lives of the enlisted
men aboard the <em>Glory of
the Galaxy</em> and the passengers
on its maiden run, would be
snuffed out in a brilliant burst
of solar heat.</p>

<p>And the President of the
Galactic Federation would die
because some unknown factor
had locked the controls of the
spaceship, making it impossible
to turn or use forward
rockets against the gravitational
pull of the sun.</p>

<p>Nineteen million miles. In
normal space, a considerable
distance. A hundred miles a
second—a very considerable
normal space speed. Increasing….</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ever since they had left
Earth’s assembly satellites,
Sheila Kelly had seen a lot of
a Secret Serviceman named
Larry Grange, who was a
member of the President’s
corps of bodyguards. She liked
Larry, although there was
nothing serious in their relationship.
He was handsome
and charming and she was
naturally flattered with his attentions.
Still, although he
was older than Sheila, she
sensed that he was a boy
rather than a man and had
the odd feeling that, faced
with a real crisis, he would
confirm this tragically.</p>

<p>It was night aboard the
<i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>. Which
was to say the blue-green
night lights had replaced the
white day lights in the companionways
<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>and public rooms
of the spaceship, since its
ports were sealed against the
fierce glare of the sun. It was
hard to believe, Sheila
thought, that they were only
nineteen million miles from
the sun. Everything was so
cool—so comfortably air-conditioned….</p>

<p>She met Larry in the Sunside
Lounge, a cabaret as nice
as any terran nightclub she
had ever seen. There were
stylistic Zodiac drawings on
the walls and blue-mirrored
columns supporting the roof.
Like everything else aboard
the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>, the
Sunside Lounge hardly
seemed to belong on a spaceship.
For Sheila Kelly, though—herself
a third secretary
with the department of Galactic
Economy—it was all very
thrilling.</p>

<p>“Hello, Larry,” she said as
the Secret Serviceman joined
her at their table. He was a
tall young man in his late
twenties with crewcut blond
hair; but he sat down heavily
now and did not offer Sheila
his usual smile.</p>

<p>“Why, what on earth is the
matter?” Sheila asked him.</p>

<p>“Nothing. I need a drink,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>The drinks came. Larry
gulped his and ordered another.
His complete silence
baffled Sheila, who finally
said:</p>

<p>“Surely it isn’t anything I
did.”</p>

<p>“You? Don’t be silly.”</p>

<p>“Well! After the way you
said that I don’t know if I
should be glad or not.”</p>

<p>“Just forget it. I’m sorry,
kid. I—” He reached out and
touched her hand. His own
hand was damp and cold.</p>

<p>“Going to tell me, Larry?”</p>

<p>“Listen. What’s a guy supposed
to do if he overhears
something he’s not supposed
to overhear, and—”</p>

<p>“How should I know unless
you tell me what you overheard?
It is you you’re talking
about, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I was going off duty,
walking by officer quarters
and … oh, forget it. I better
not tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’m a good listener,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“Look, Irish. You’re a good
anything—and that’s the
truth. You have looks and you
have brains and I have a
hunch through all that Emerald
Isle sauciness you have a
heart too. But—”</p>

<p>“But you don’t want to tell
me.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t I don’t want to, but
no one’s supposed to know, not
even the President.”</p>

<p>“You sure make it sound
mysterious.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>“Just the officers. Oh, hell.
I don’t know. What good
would it do if I told you?”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d just get it off
your chest, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell anyone official,
Sheila. I’d have my head
handed to me. But I’ve got to
think and I’ve got to tell someone.
I’ll go crazy, just knowing
and not doing anything.”</p>

<p>“It’s important, isn’t it?”</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Larry downed another
drink quickly. It was his
fourth and Sheila had never
seen him take more than three
or four in the course of
a whole evening. “You’re
damned right it’s important.”
Larry leaned forward across
the postage-stamp table. A
liquor-haze clouded his eyes as
he said: “It’s so important
that unless someone does
something about it, we’ll all be
dead inside of twenty-four
hours. Only trouble is, there
isn’t anything anyone can do
about it.”</p>

<p>“Larry—you’re a little
drunk.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I know I am. I
want to be a lot drunker. What
the hell can a guy do?”</p>

<p>“What do you know, Larry?
What have you heard?”</p>

<p>“I know they have the President
of the Galactic Federation
aboard this ship and that
he ought to be told the truth.”</p>

<p>“No. I mean—”</p>

<p>“They sent out an SOS, kid.
Controls are locked. Lifeboats
don’t have enough power to
get us out of the sun’s gravitational
pull. We’re all going
to roast, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Sheila felt her heart throb
wildly. Even though he was
well on the way to being thoroughly
drunk, Larry was telling
the truth. Instinctively,
she knew that—was certain
of it. “What are you going to
do?” she said.</p>

<p>He shrugged. “I guess because
I can’t do a damned
thing I’m going to get good
and drunk. That’s what I’m
going to do. Or maybe—who
the hell knows?—maybe in
one minute I’m going to jump
up on this table and tell everyone
what I overheard. Maybe
I ought to do that, huh?”</p>

<p>“Larry, Larry—if it’s as
bad as you say, maybe you
ought to think before you do
anything.”</p>

<p>“Who am I to think? I’m
one of the muscle men. That’s
what they pay me for, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Larry. You don’t have to
shout.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t calm down I’ll
have to leave.”</p>

<p>“You can sit still. You can
park here all night. <em>I’m</em> leaving.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>“What are you going to
do?”</p>

<p>“Oh … that.” Larry got up
from the table. He looked suddenly
green and Sheila
thought it was because he had
too much to drink. “You don’t
have to worry about that,
Sheila. Not now you don’t. I
all of a sudden don’t feel so
good. Headache. Man, I never
felt anything like it. Better go
to my cabin and lie down.
Maybe I’ll wake up and find
out all this was a dream,
huh?”</p>

<p>“Do you need any help?”
Sheila demanded, real concern
in her voice.</p>

<p>“No. ’Sall right. Man, this
headache really snuck up on
me. Pow! Without any warning.”</p>

<p>“Let me help you.”</p>

<p>“No. Just leave me alone,
will you?” Larry staggered off
across the crowded dance
floor. He drew angry glances
and muttered comments as he
disturbed the dancers waltzing
to Carlotti’s <em>Danube in
Space</em>.</p>

<p>Why don’t you admit it,
Grange, Larry thought as he
staggered through the companionway
toward his cabin.
That’s what you always wanted,
isn’t it—a place of importance?</p>

<p>A place in the sun, they call
it.</p>

<p>“You’re going to get a place
in the sun, all right,” he
mumbled aloud. “Right smack
in the middle of the sun with
everyone else aboard this
ship!”</p>

<p>The humor of it amused him
perversely. He smiled—but it
was closer to a leer—and
lunged into his cabin. What he
said to Sheila was no joke. He
really did have a splitting
headache. It had come on suddenly
and it was like no headache
he had ever known. It
pulsed and throbbed and beat
against his temples and held
red hot needles to the backs of
his eyeballs, almost blinding
him. It sapped all his strength,
leaving him physically weak.
He was barely able to close
the door behind him and stagger
to the shower.</p>

<p>An ice cold shower, he
thought would help. He
stripped quickly and got under
the needle spray. By that
time he was so weak he could
barely stand.</p>

<p>A place in the sun, he
thought….</p>

<p>Something grabbed his
mind and wrenched it.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Johnny Mayhem awoke.</p>

<p>Awakening came slowly, as
it always did. It was a rising
through infinite gulfs, a rebirth
for a man who had died
a hundred times and might die
<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>a thousand times more as the
years piled up and became
centuries. It was a spinning,
whirling, flashing ascent from
blackness to coruscating colors,
brightness, giddiness.</p>

<p>And suddenly, it was over.</p>

<p>A needle spray of ice-cold
water beat down upon him.
He shuddered and reached for
the water-taps, shutting them.
Dripping, he climbed from the
shower.</p>

<p>And floated up—quite
weightless—toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>Frowning with his new and
as yet unseen face, Johnny
Mayhem propelled himself to
the floor. He looked at his
arms. He was naked—at least
that much was right.</p>

<p>But obviously, since he was
weightless, he was not on
Deneb IV. During his transmigration
he had been briefed
for the trouble on Deneb IV.
Then had a mistake been made
somehow? It was always possible—but
it had never happened
before.</p>

<p>Too much precision and
careful planning was involved.</p>

<p>Every world which had an
Earthman population and a
Galactic League—now, Galactic
Federation—post, must
have a body in cold storage,
waiting for Johnny Mayhem
if his services were required.
No one knew when Mayhem’s
services might be required. No
one knew exactly under what
circumstances the Galactic
Federation Council, operating
from the Hub of the Galaxy,
might summon Mayhem. And
only a very few people, including
those at the Hub and the
Galactic League Firstmen on
civilized worlds and Observers
on frontier planets, knew the
precise mechanics of Mayhem’s
coming.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Johnny Mayhem, a bodiless
sentience. Mayhem—Johnny
Marlow then—who had been
chased from Earth a pariah
and a criminal seven years
ago, who had been mortally
wounded on a wild planet
deep within the Sagittarian
Swarm, whose life had been
saved—after a fashion—by
the white magic of that
planet. Mayhem, doomed now
to possible immortality as a
bodiless sentience, an <em>elan</em>,
which could occupy and activate
a corpse if it had been
preserved properly … an <em>elan</em>
doomed to wander eternally
because it could not remain in
one body for more than a
month without body and <em>elan</em>
perishing. Mayhem, who had
dedicated his strange, lonely
life to the services of the Galactic
League—now the Galactic
Federation—because a
normal life and normal social
<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>relations were not possible to
him….</p>

<p>It did not seem possible,
Mayhem thought now, that a
mistake could be made. Then—a
sudden change in plans?</p>

<p>It had never happened before,
but it was entirely possible.
Something, Mayhem
decided, had come up during
transmigration. It was terribly
important and the people
at the Hub had had no opportunity
to brief him on it.</p>

<p>But—what?</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">His first shock came a moment
later. He walked to a
mirror on the wall and approved
of the strong young
body which would house his
sentience and then scowled. A
thought inside his head said:</p>

<p><em>So this is what it’s like to
have schizophrenia.</em></p>

<p><em>What the hell was that?</em>
Mayhem thought.</p>

<p><em>I said, so this is what it’s
like to have schizophrenia.
First the world’s worst headache
and then I start thinking
like two different people.</em></p>

<p><em>Aren’t you dead?</em></p>

<p><em>Is that supposed to be a
joke, alter ego? When do the
men in the white suits come?</em></p>

<p><em>Good Lord, this was supposed
to be a dead body!</em></p>

<p>At that, the other sentience
which shared the body with
Mayhem snickered and lapsed
into silence. Mayhem, for his
part, was astounded.</p>

<p><em>Don’t get ornery now</em>, Mayhem
pleaded. <em>I’m Johnny
Mayhem. Does that mean anything
to you?</em></p>

<p><em>Oh, sure. It means I’m dead.
You inhabit dead bodies,
right?</em></p>

<p><em>Usually. Listen—where are
we?</em></p>

<p><em><i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>—bound
from Earth to Mars on perihelion.</em></p>

<p><em>And there’s trouble?</em></p>

<p><em>How do you know there’s
trouble?</em></p>

<p><em>Otherwise they wouldn’t
have diverted me here.</em></p>

<p><em>We’ve got the president
aboard. We’re going to hit the
sun.</em> Then, grudgingly, Larry
went into the details. When he
finished he thought cynically:
<em>Now all you have to do is go
outside yelling have no fear,
Mayhem is here and everything
will be all right, I suppose.</em></p>

<p>Mayhem didn’t answer. It
would be many moments yet
before he could adjust to this
new, unexpected situation.
But in a way, he thought, it
would be a boon. If he were
co-inhabiting the body of a
living man who belonged on
the <em>Glory of the Galaxy</em>, there
was no need to reveal his identity
as Johnny Mayhem to
anyone but his host….</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"> </a>“I tell ya,” Technician First
Class Ackerman Boone shouted,
“the refrigeration unit’s
gone on the blink. You can’t
feel it yet, but I ought to
know. I got the refrigs working
full strength and we
gained a couple of degrees
heat. Either she’s on the blink
or we’re too close to the sun,
I tell you!”</p>

<p>Ackerman Boone was a big
man, a veteran spacer with a
squat, very strong body and
arms like an orangutan. Under
normal circumstances he
was a very fine spacer and a
good addition to any crew, but
he bore an unreasonable
grudge against the officer
corps and would go out of his
way to make them look bad in
the eyes of the other enlisted
men. A large crowd had gathered
in the hammock-hung
crew quarters of the <em>Glory of
the Galaxy</em> as Boone went on
in his deep, booming voice:
“So I asked the skipper of the
watch, I did. He got shifty-eyed,
like they always do. You
know. He wasn’t talking, but
sure as my name’s Ackerman
Boone, something’s wrong.”</p>

<p>“What do you think it is,
Acky?” one of the younger
men asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I tell ya this: I know
what it <em>isn’t</em>. I checked out the
refrigs three times, see, and
came up with nothing. The refrigs
are in jig order, and if
I know it then you know it. So,
if the refrigs are in jig order,
there’s only one thing it can
be: we’re getting too near the
sun!” Boone clamped his
mouth shut and stood with
thick, muscular arms crossed
over his barrel chest.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">A young technician third
class said in a strident voice,
“You mean you think maybe
we’re plunging into the sun,
Acky?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I didn’t say
that. Did I, boy? But we <em>are</em>
too close and if we are too
close there’s got to be a reason
for it. If we stay too close too
long, O.K. Then we’re plunging
into the sun. Right now, I
dunno.”</p>

<p>They all asked Ackerman
Boone, who was an unofficial
leader among them, what he
was going to do. He rubbed
his big fingers against the
thick stubble of beard on his
jaw and you could hear the
rasping sound it made. Then
he said, “Nothing, until we
find out for sure. But I got a
hunch the officers are trying
to pull the wool over the eyes
of them politicians we got on
board. That’s all right with
me, men. If they want to, they
got their reasons. But I tell
ya this: they ain’t going to
pull any wool over Acky
<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"> </a>Boone’s eyes, and that’s a
fact.”</p>

<p>Just then the squawk box
called: “Now hear this! Now
hear this! Tech/1 Ackerman
Boone to Exec’s office. Tech/1
Boone to Exec.”</p>

<p>“You see?” Boone said,
smiling grimly. As yet, no one
saw. His face still set in a
grim smile, Ackerman Boone
headed above decks.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“That, Mr. President,” Vice
Admiral T. Shawnley Stapleton
said gravely, “is the
problem. We would have come
to you sooner, sir, but
frankly—”</p>

<p>“I know it, Admiral,” the
President said quietly. “I
could not have helped you in
any way. There was no sense
telling me.”</p>

<p>“We have one chance, sir,
and one only. It’s irregular
and it will probably knock the
hell out of the <em>Glory of the
Galaxy</em>, but it may save our
lives. If we throw the ship
suddenly into subspace we
could pass right through the
sun’s position and—”</p>

<p>“I’m no scientist, Admiral,
but wouldn’t that put tremendous
stress not only on the
ship but on all of us aboard?”</p>

<p>“It would, sir. I won’t keep
anything from you, of course.
We’d all be subjected to a
force of twenty-some gravities
for a period of several seconds.
Here aboard the <i>Glory</i>,
we don’t have adequate G-equipment.
It’s something like
the old days of air flight, sir:
as soon as airplanes became
reasonably safe, passenger
ships didn’t bother to carry
parachutes. Result over a
period of fifty years: thousands
of lives lost. We’d all be
bruised and battered, sir.
Bones would be broken. There
might be a few deaths. But I
see no other way out, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then there was no need to
check with me at all, I assure
you, Admiral Stapleton. Do
whatever you think is best,
sir.”</p>

<p>The Admiral nodded gravely.
“Thank you, Mr. President.
I will say this, though: we will
wait for a miracle.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t follow
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t expect a miracle,
but the switchover to subspace
so suddenly is bound to
be dangerous. Therefore, we’ll
wait until the last possible
moment. It will grow uncomfortably
warm, let me warn
you, but as long as the subspace
drive is in good working
order—”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean, Admiral.
You have a free hand,
sir; let me repeat that. I will
not interfere in any way and
I have the utmost confidence
<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>in you.” The President mopped
his brow with an already
damp handkerchief. It <em>was</em>
growing warm, come to think
of it. Uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p>As if everyone aboard the
<i>Glory of the Galaxy</i> was slowly
being broiled alive….</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ackerman Boone entered
the crew quarters with the
same smile still on his lips. At
first he said nothing, but his
silence drew the men like a
magnet draws iron filings.
When they had all clustered
about him he spoke.</p>

<p>“The Exec not only chewed
my ears off,” he boomed. “He
all but spit them in my face!
I was right, men. He admitted
it to me after he saw how he
couldn’t get away with anything
in front of Ackerman
Boone. Men, we’re heading on
collision course with the sun!”</p>

<p>A shocked silence greeted
his words and Ackerman
Boone, instinctively a born
speaker, paused dramatically
to allow each man the private
horror of his own thoughts for
a few moments. Then he continued:
“The Admiral figures
we have one chance to get
out of this alive, men. He
figures—”</p>

<p>“What is it, Acky?”</p>

<p>“What will he do?”</p>

<p>“How will the Admiral get
us out of this?”</p>

<p>Ackerman Boone spat on
the polished, gleaming floor of
the crew quarters. “He’ll
never get us out alive, let me
tell you. He wants to shift us
into subspace at the last possible
minute. Suddenly. Like
this—” and Ackerman Boone
snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>“There’d be a ship full of
broken bones!” someone protested.
“We can’t do a thing
like that.”</p>

<p>“He’ll kill us all!” a very
young T/3 cried hysterically.</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it, he
won’t,” shouted Ackerman
Boone. “Listen, men. This
ain’t a question of discipline.
It’s a question of living or dying
and I tell you that’s more
important than doing it like
the book says or discipline or
anything like that. We got a
chance, all right: but it ain’t
what the Admiral thinks it is.
We ought to abandon the
<i>Glory</i> to her place in the sun
and scram out of here in the
lifeboats—every last person
aboard ship.”</p>

<p>“But will they have enough
power to get out of the sun’s
gravitational pull?” someone
asked.</p>

<p>Ackerman Boone shrugged.
“Don’t look at me,” he said
mockingly. “I’m only an enlisted
man and they don’t give
enlisted men enough math to
answer questions like that.
<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>But reckoning by the seat of
my pants I would say, yes.
Yes, we could get away like
that—if we act fast. Because
every minute we waste is a
minute that brings us closer
to the sun and makes it harder
to get away in the lifeboats. If
we act, men, we got to act
fast.”</p>

<p>“You’re talking mutiny,
Boone,” a grizzled old space
veteran said. “You can count
me out.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, McCormick?
Yellow?”</p>

<p>“I’m not yellow. I say it
takes guts to maintain discipline
in a real emergency. I say
<em>you’re</em> yellow, Boone.”</p>

<p>“You better be ready to
back that up with your fists,
McCormick,” Boone said
savagely.</p>

<p>“I’m ready any time you’re
ready, you yellow mutinous
bastard!”</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ackerman Boone launched
himself at the smaller, older
man, who stood his ground
unflinchingly although he
probably knew he would take
a sound beating. But four or
five crewmen came between
them and held them apart, one
saying:</p>

<p>“Look who’s talking, Boone.
You say time’s precious but
you’re all set to start fighting.
Every minute—”</p>

<p>“Every <em>second</em>,” Boone said
grimly, “brings us more than
a hundred miles closer to the
sun.”</p>

<p>“What can we do, Acky?”</p>

<p>Instead of answer, Ackerman
Boone dramatically mopped
the sweat from his face.
All the men were uncomfortably
warm now. It was obvious
that the temperature
within the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>
had now climbed fifteen or
twenty degrees despite the
fact that the refrigs were
working at full capacity. Even
the bulkheads and the metal
floor of crew quarters were
unpleasantly warm to the
touch. The air was hot and
suddenly very dry.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we ought
to do,” Ackerman Boone said
finally. “Admiral Stapleton or
no Admiral Stapleton, President
of the Galactic Federation
or no President of the
Galactic Federation, we ought
to take over this ship and man
the life boats for everyone’s
good. If they don’t want to
save their lives and ours—let’s
us save our lives and theirs!”</p>

<p>Roars of approval greeted
Boone’s words, but Spacer
McCormick and some of the
other veterans stood apart
from the loud speech-making
which followed. Actually,
Boone’s wild words—which he
gambled with after the first
<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"> </a>flush of enthusiasm for his
plan—began to lose converts.
One by one the men drifted
toward McCormick’s silent
group until, finally, Boone had
lost almost his entire audience.</p>

<p>Just then a T/2 rushed into
crew quarters and shouted:
“Hey, is Boone around? Has
anyone seen Boone?”</p>

<p>This brought general laughter.
Under the circumstances,
the question was not without
its humorous aspect.</p>

<p>“What’ll you have?” Boone
demanded.</p>

<p>“The refrigs, Boone! They
are on the blink. Overstrained
themselves and burned themselves
out. Inside of half an
hour this ship’s going to be an
oven hot enough to kill us all!”</p>

<p>“Half an hour, men!” Ackerman
Boone cried. “Now, do
we take over the ship and man
those lifeboats or don’t we!”</p>

<p>The roar which followed his
words was a decidedly affirmative
one.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“These are the figures,” Admiral
Stapleton said. “You can
see, Mr. President, that we
have absolutely no chance
whatever if we man the lifeboats.
We would perish as assuredly
as we would if we remained
with the <em>Glory of the
Galaxy</em> in normal space.”</p>

<p>“Admiral, I have to hand it
to you. I don’t know how you
can think—in all this heat.”</p>

<p>“Have to, sir. Otherwise we
all die.”</p>

<p>“The air temperature—”</p>

<p>“Is a hundred and thirty
degrees and rising. We’ve
passed salt tablets out to
everyone, sir, but even then
it’s only a matter of time before
we’re all prostrated. If
you’re sure you give your permission,
sir—”</p>

<p>“Admiral Stapleton, you are
running this ship, not I.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. I’ve sent
our subspace officer, Lieutenant
Ormundy, to throw in the
subspace drive. We should
know in a few moments—”</p>

<p>“No crash hammocks or
anything?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t your fault, Admiral.
I was merely pointing
out a fact.”</p>

<p>The <ins title="original reads 'squack'">squawk</ins> box blared:
“Now hear this! Now hear
this! T/3 Ackerman Boone to
Admiral Stapleton. Are you
listening, Admiral?”</p>

<p>Admiral Stapleton’s haggard,
heat-worn face bore a
look of astonishment as he
listened. Ackerman said, “We
have Lieutenant Ormundy,
Admiral. He’s not killing us
all by putting us into subspace
in minutes when it ought to
take hours, you understand.
We have Ormundy and we
<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"> </a>have the subspace room. A
contingent of our men is getting
the lifeboats ready. We’re
going to abandon ship, Admiral,
all of us, including you
and the politicians even if we
have to drag you aboard the
lifeboats at N—gunpoint.”</p>

<p>Admiral Stapleton’s face
went ashen. “Let me at a radio!”
he roared. “I want to
answer that man and see if
he understands exactly what
mutiny is!”</p>

<p>While Ackerman Boone was
talking over the squawk box,
the temperature within the
<i>Glory of the Galaxy</i> rose to
145° Fahrenheit.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Fifteen minutes,” Larry
Grange said. “In fifteen
minutes the heat will have us
all unconscious.” Only it
wasn’t Larry alone who was
talking. It was Larry and
Johnny Mayhem. In a surprisingly
short time the young
Secret Serviceman had come
to accept the dual occupation
of his own mind. It was there:
it was either dual occupation
or insanity and if the voice
which spoke inside his head
said it was Johnny Mayhem,
then it was Johnny Mayhem.
Besides, Larry felt clear-headed
in a way he had never
felt before, despite the terrible,
sapping heat. It was as
if he had matured suddenly—the
word matured came to him
instinctively—in the space of
minutes. Or, as if a maturing
influence were at work on his
mind.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” Sheila
said. “The crew has complete
control of the ship.”</p>

<p>“Secret Service chief says
we’re on our own. There’s no
time for co-ordinated planning,
but somehow, within a
very few minutes, we’ve got
to get inside the subspace
room and throw the ship out
of normal space or we’ll all be
roasted.”</p>

<p>“Some of your men are
there now, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“In the companionway outside
the subspace room, yeah.
But they’ll never force their
way in time. Not with blasters
and not with N-guns, either.
Not in ten minutes, they
won’t.”</p>

<p>“Larry, all of a sudden I—I’m
scared. We’re all going to
die, Larry. I don’t want—Larry,
what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>They had been walking in a
deserted companionway which
brought them to one of the
aft escape hatches of the
<i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>. Their
clothing was plastered to their
bodies with sweat and every
breath was agonizing, furnace
hot.</p>

<p>“I’m going outside,” Larry
said quietly.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"> </a>“Outside? What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Spacesuit, outside. There’s
a hatch in the subspace room.
If their attention is diverted
to the companionway door, I
may be able to get in. It’s our
only chance—ours, and everyone’s.”</p>

<p>“But the spacesuit—”</p>

<p>“I know,” Larry said even
as he was climbing into the
inflatable vacuum garment. It
was Larry—and it wasn’t
Larry. He felt a certain confidence,
a certain sense of doing
the right thing—a feeling
which Larry Grange had
never experienced before in
his life. It was as if the boy
had become a man in the final
moments of his life—or, he
thought all at once, it was as
if Johnny Mayhem who
shared his mind and his body
with him was somehow transmitting
some of his own skills
and confidence even as he—Mayhem—had
reached the decision
to go outside.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said. “The
spacesuit isn’t insulated sufficiently.
I’ll have about three
minutes out there. Three minutes
to get inside. Otherwise,
I’m finished.”</p>

<p>“But Larry—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, Sheila?
What does it matter? Who
wants the five or ten extra
minutes if we’re all going to
die anyway? This way, there’s
a chance.”</p>

<p>He buckled the spacesuit
and lifted the heavy fishbowl
helmet, preparing to set it on
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Sheila said, and
stood on tiptoes to take his
face in her hands and kiss him
on the lips. “You—you’re different,”
Sheila said. “You’re
the same guy, a lot of fun, but
you’re a—man, too. This is
for what might have been,
Larry,” she said, and kissed
him again. “This is because I
love you.”</p>

<p>Before he dropped the helmet
in place, Larry said. “It
isn’t for what might have
been, Sheila. It’s for what will
be.”</p>

<p>The helmet snapped shut
over the shoulder ridges of the
spacesuit. Moments later, he
had slipped into the airlock.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“I say you’re a fool, Ackerman
Boone!” one of the enlisted
men rasped at the leader
of the mutiny. “I say now
we’ve lost our last chance.
Now it’s too late to get into
the lifeboats even if we
wanted to. Now all we can do
is—die!”</p>

<p>There were still ten conscious
men in the subspace
room. The others had fallen
before heat prostration and
lay strewn about the floor,
<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"> </a>wringing wet and oddly flaccid
as if all the moisture had
been wrung from their bodies
except for the sweat which
covered their skins.</p>

<p>“All right,” Ackerman
Boone admitted. “All right, so
none of us knows how to work
the subspace mechanism. You
think that would have helped?
It would have killed us all, I
tell you.”</p>

<p>“It was a chance, Boone.
Our last chance and you—”</p>

<p>“Just shut up!” Boone
snarled. “I know what you’re
thinking. You’re thinking we
ought to let them officers and
Secret Servicemen to ram
home the subspace drive. But
use your head, man. Probably
they’ll kill us all, but if they
don’t—”</p>

<p>“Then you admit there’s a
chance!”</p>

<p>“Yeah. All right, a chance.
But if they don’t kill us all, if
they save us by ramming
home the subspacer, what happens?
We’re all taken in on a
mutiny charge. It’s a capital
offense, you fool!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s better than sure
death,” the man said, and
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“Allister, wait!” Boone
cried. “Wait, I’m warning you.
Any man who tries to open
that door—”</p>

<p>Outside, a steady booming
of blaster fire could be heard,
but the assault-proof door
stood fast.</p>

<p>“—is going to get himself
killed!” Boone finished.</p>

<p>Grimly, Allister reached the
door and got his already blistered
fingers on the lock mechanism.</p>

<p>Ackerman Boone shot him
in the back with an N-gun.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Larry’s whole body felt like
one raw mass of broken blisters
as, flat on his belly, he
inched his way along the outside
hull of the <em>Glory of the
Galaxy</em>. He had no idea what
the heat was out here, but it
radiated off the hot hull of the
<i>Glory</i> in scalding, suffocating
waves which swept right
through the insulining of the
spacesuit. If he didn’t find the
proper hatch, and in a matter
of seconds….</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Anyone else?” Ackerman
Boone screamed. “Anyone else
like Allister?”</p>

<p>But one by one the remaining
men were dropping from
the heat. Finally—alone—Ackerman
Boone faced the
door and stared defiantly at
the hot metal as if he could see
his adversaries through it. On
the other side, the firing became
more sporadic as the officers
and Secret Servicemen
collapsed. His mind crazed
with the heat and with fear,
<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>Ackerman Boone suddenly
wished he could see the men
through the door, wished he
could see them die….</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">It was this hatch or nothing.
He thought it was the
right one, but couldn’t be sure.
He could no longer see. His
vision had gone completely.
The pain was a numb thing
now, far away, hardly a part
of himself. Maybe Mayhem
was absorbing the pain-sensation
for him, he thought.
Maybe Mayhem took the pain
and suffered with it in the
shared body so he, Larry,
could still think. Maybe—</p>

<p>His blistered fingers were
barely able to move within the
insulined gloves, Larry fumbled
with the hatch.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ackerman Boone whirled
suddenly. He had been intent
upon the companionway door
and the sounds behind him—which
he had heard but not
registered as dangerous for
several seconds—now made
him turn.</p>

<p>The man was peeling off a
space suit. Literally peeling it
off in strips from his lobster-red
flesh. He blinked at Boone
without seeing him. Dazzle-blinded,
Boone thought, then
realized his own vision was
going.</p>

<p>“I’ll kill you if you go near
that subspace drive!” Boone
screamed.</p>

<p>“It’s the only chance for all
of us and you know it, Boone,”
the man said quietly. “Don’t
try to stop me.”</p>

<p>Ackerman Boone lifted his
N-gun and squinted through
the haze of heat and blinding
light. He couldn’t see! He
couldn’t see….</p>

<p>Wildly, he fired the N-gun.
Wildly, in all directions,
spraying the room with it—</p>

<p>Larry dropped blindly forward.
Twice he tripped over
unconscious men, but climbed
to his feet and went on. He
could not see Boone, but he
could see—vaguely—the muzzle
flash of Boone’s N-gun. He
staggered across the room toward
that muzzle-flash and finally
embraced it—</p>

<p>And found himself fighting
for his life. Boone was crazed
now—with the heat and with
his own failure. He bit and
tore at Larry with strong
claw-like fingers and lashed
out with his feet. He balled his
fists and hammered air like a
windmill, arms flailing, striking
flesh often enough to batter
Larry toward the floor.</p>

<p>Grimly Larry clung to him,
pulled himself upright, ducked
his head against his chest and
struck out with his own fists,
feeling nothing, not knowing
when they landed and when
<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>they did not, hearing nothing
but a far off roaring in his
ears, a roaring which told him
he was losing consciousness
and had to act—soon—if he
was going to save anyone….</p>

<p>He stood and pounded with
his fists.</p>

<p>Pounded—air.</p>

<p>He did not know that Boone
had collapsed until his feet
trod on the man’s inert body
and then, quickly, he rushed
toward the control board,
rushed blindly in its direction,
or in the direction he thought
it would be, tripped over
something, sprawled on the
hot, blistering floor, got himself
up somehow, crawled
forward, pulled himself upright….</p>

<p>There was no sensation in
his fingers. He did not know
if he had actually reached the
control board but abruptly he
realized that he had not felt
Mayhem’s presence in his
mind for several minutes. Was
Mayhem conserving his energy
for a final try, letting
Larry absorb the punishment
now so he—</p>

<p>Yes, Larry remembered
thinking vaguely. It had to be
that. For Mayhem knew how
to work the controls, and he
did not. Now his mind receded
into a fog of semi-consciousness,
but he was aware that
his blistered fingers were fairly
flying across the control
board, aware then of an inward
sigh—whether of relief
or triumph, he was never to
know—then aware, abruptly
and terribly, of a wrenching
pain which seemed to strip his
skin from his flesh, his flesh
from his bones, the marrow
from….</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Can you see?” the doctor
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Larry said as the
bandages were removed from
his eyes. Three people were in
the room with the doctor—Admiral
Stapleton, the President—and
Sheila. Somehow,
Sheila was most important.</p>

<p>“We are now in subspace,
thanks to you,” the Admiral
said. “We all have minor injuries
as a result of the transfer,
but there were only two
fatalities, I’m happy to say.
And naturally, the ship is now
out of danger.”</p>

<p>“What gets me, Grange,”
the President said, “is how
you managed to work those
controls. What the devil do
you know about sub-space, my
boy?”</p>

<p>“The two fatalities,” the
Admiral said, “were Ackerman
Boone and the man he
had killed.” Then the Admiral
grinned. “Can’t you see, Mr.
President, that he’s not paying
any attention to us? I think,
<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>at the moment, the hero of the
hour only has eyes for Miss
Kelly here.”</p>

<p>“Begging your pardons,
sirs, yes,” Larry said happily.</p>

<p>Nodding and smiling, the
President of the Galactic Federation
and Admiral Stapleton
left the dispensary room—with
the doctor.</p>

<p>“Well, hero,” Sheila said,
and smiled.</p>

<p>Larry realized—quite suddenly—that,
inside himself,
he was alone. Mayhem had
done his job—and vanished
utterly.</p>

<p>“You know,” Sheila said,
“it’s as if you—well, I hope
this doesn’t get you sore at
me—as if you grew up overnight.”</p>

<p>Before he kissed her Larry
said: “Maybe you’re right.
Maybe I’ll tell you about it
someday. But you’d never believe
me.”</p>
